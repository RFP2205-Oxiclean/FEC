# FEC

Getting Started:

```
npm install
npm start
```


----NORMAL WORKFLOW----

  - pick up a ticket from Trello for a task to work on
  - run 'git pull origin main' to fetch the latest code from our main branch to your local machine
  - run 'git checkout -b [your-branch-name]' to create a new branch, from which you will work on your task
  - git add . and git commit often, and as usual!
  - when completed, run 'git push origin [your-branch-name]', which will push your code to the repo, and it will be under your branch

  - navigate to our repo at https://github.com/RFP2205-Oxiclean/FEC
  - you should see your latest push on the main page
  - CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES FROM OTHER TEAM MEMBERS!
    - if yes:
      run 'git checkout main'
      run 'git pull origin main'
      run 'git merge master'
        -> if there are no merge conflicts, you're good to submit your PR on Github
        -> if there are merge conflicts, decide which version you and the other collaborator want to keep. Ideally, reach out to the other person to discuss.
    - if no:
      submit your pull request

----PR SUBMISSION WORKFLOW----
  - After following the steps from above, you should be ready to submit your PR
  - Include a descriptive title for the PR request
  - Be sure to tag everyone in the group in the PR description

----PR APPROVAL WORKFLOW----
  - All proposed changes to the main branch will be submitted via Pull Request by individual contributors
  - Each member should have been tagged and alerted when a new PR comes through
  - A PR has to be approved by at least 1 other member (ideally 2+) before being merged to the main branch
  - *NEEDS AN UPDATE* When in the specific pull request, change the button to "MERGE PULL REQUEST"
